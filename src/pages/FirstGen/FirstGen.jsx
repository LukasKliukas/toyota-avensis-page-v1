          Toyota introduced the Avensis nameplate on its new model, which was
          launched at the end of 1997. Although an extensive revamp of the
          previous generation Carina E, the only main common parts were the
          engines, with an all new style of body. The car was built at the
          Burnaston factory in Derby. At the same time, production of the
          five-door Toyota Corolla also started at the British plant. The first
          generation Avensis had the option of four engines (1.6-, 1.8- and
          2.0-litre petrol and a 2.0-litre turbo-diesel) and three body styles
          (saloon, hatchback and estate). The station wagon was essentially the
          Japanese-market second generation Toyota Caldina. All of the range
          gave solid build quality, excellent reliability, a spacious
          comfortable interior, generous equipment, smooth ride quality and good
          refinement, but very little in the way of excitement. The first
          generation Avensis received a facelift in August 2000. The engines
          were fitted with variable valve timing, satellite navigation was
          included as a standard feature along the range and the sporty Avensis
          2.0 L SR (with body kit and tuned suspension) was added but overall
          sales remained low. The first generation Avensis was also sold in
          South America. In Argentina and Brazil, it was sold as the Toyota
          Corona (as seen on brochures), but in Chile and Peru, it was sold as
          the Corona Avensis.

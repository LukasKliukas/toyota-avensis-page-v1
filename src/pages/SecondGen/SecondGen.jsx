          The second generation Avensis was launched in February 2003, in an all
          new format; this time it offered more in the way of driver involvement
          and visual appeal. It was launched in Japan in saloon and estate form
          in October 2003, replacing the V50 series Vista and Vista Ardeo. Like
          the Echo/Yaris and Corolla, it was penned by the company's design
          studio in France.[2] Production officially began on 6 January 2003.
          Following the withdrawal of the Camry in 2004 (2005 in Switzerland),
          the Avensis became the largest Toyota saloon sold in Western Europe.
          Trim levels in the United Kingdom were T2, T3-S, T3-X, T4, T Spirit,
          T180 and TR. There is also a special edition, based on the T2 called
          the Colour Collection. In Ireland, there were five trim levels â€“
          Terra, Aura, Strata, Luna and Sol. In Japan, the Avensis is sold as
          2.0 Xi, 2.0 Li (later replaced by 2.4 Li) and 2.4 Qi. Only the base
          model 2.0 Xi is offered with four-wheel drive. This is first and only
          generation of Avensis sold in Egypt and Morocco, not in Persian Gulf
          countries.[citation needed] In the 2004 European Car of the Year
          contest, the Avensis came in fourth place behind the Fiat Panda
          (winner), Mazda3 (second) and the Volkswagen Golf (third). However, it
          won the 2004 Semperit Irish Car of the Year. What Car? also awarded
          the Avensis as the "Best Family Car" for 2004 and 2005.

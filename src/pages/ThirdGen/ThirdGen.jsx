          The third generation Avensis was revealed at the 2008 Paris Motor
          Show. It went on sale in January 2009. Like the previous model, it is
          built at Toyota's Burnaston plant in Derbyshire, England. This
          generation is available in saloon or estate styles only.[8] The third
          generation Avensis full-year sales goal was of 115,000 vehicles.[9]
          Toyota ED2 initially designed the Avensis giving it a more sleek and
          athletic stance. It has a drag coefficient of Cd=0.28 for the saloon
          and Cd=0.29 for the wagon body. Other design goals were to create the
          most comfortable suspension in its class while still offering sporty
          handling. The Avensis continued to use front MacPherson struts and
          rear double wishbones. Unlike the previous generation Avensis models,
          there is no five door hatchback body style in this lineup, in favour
          of saloon and estate body styles. Major options include bi xenon HID
          headlamps, Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS), and adaptive cruise
          control. The Avensis wagon began being imported again to Japan in
          mid-2011, with 2.0-litre 4-cylinder engine and CVT transmission in Li
          and Xi variants.[10] The Avensis wagon was discontinued in Japan on 27
          April 2018.
